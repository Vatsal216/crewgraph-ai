Natural Language Processing for CrewGraph AI

AI-powered natural language workflow building and documentation system.
Provides comprehensive NLP capabilities for converting natural language descriptions
into executable workflows, enabling conversational workflow building.

Key Components:
    - Workflow Parser: Convert natural language to workflow definitions
    - Requirements Parser: Parse natural language requirements into structured data
    - Intent Classifier: Understand user intentions and requirements
    - Task Extractor: Extract individual tasks from descriptions
    - Dependency Analyzer: Identify task dependencies from context
    - NL Converters: Bidirectional natural language conversion
    - Conversational Builder: Interactive workflow building
    - Documentation Generator: Auto-generate comprehensive documentation
    - Code Generator: Generate executable code from workflows

Features:
    - Natural language to workflow conversion
    - Conversational workflow building
    - Auto-documentation generation
    - Code generation for multiple languages
    - Context-aware task extraction
    - Bidirectional natural language conversion
